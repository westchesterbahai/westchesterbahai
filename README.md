## For quick changes
* Navigate to the document you wish to edit.
* Click the "pencil" icon to make edits, click again when done.

## Full Local Installation
* Fork the repository
* Go to settings and set Github Pages source as master.
* Your clone should be ready and navigable under the published link.

workflow probably doesn't apply to you.
